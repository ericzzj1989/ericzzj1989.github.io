Hello! My name is Zhenjun Zhao (赵祯俊). I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate of Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). At CUHK, I am supervised by [Ben M. Chen](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~bmchen) as a part of the [Unmanned Systems Research Group](https://http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/). I completed a Master’s degree in Navigation, Guidance and Control at [College of Automation Engineering](http://cae.nuaa.edu.cn/) of [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/). During the master, I was supervised by [Daobo Wang](http://cae.nuaa.edu.cn/2018/0906/c13664a132075/page.htm). Before this, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Automation at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/).

My broad research interest is in environmental and energy policies with a global focus on issues involving air pollution, climate change, and energy transitions. Specifically, I study the interplay between air pollution and climate change, two critical environmental challenges for humanity in the coming decades. My research uses causal inference, machine learning, atmospheric chemistry modeling, remote sensing to study the sustainability challenges at the intersection of energy, pollution and climate using real-world data. My PhD research has spanned the electricity, industrial, and transportation sectors in China, US, and EU. From a methodology perspective, I am interested in developing data-driven approaches with insights from complex atmospheric chemistry models (such as [GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/)) and understanding the uncertainty and limitations of econometric and statistical models in such application.
