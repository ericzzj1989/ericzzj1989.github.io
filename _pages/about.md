Hello! My name is Zhenjun Zhao (赵祯俊). I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate of Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). At CUHK, I am advised by [Ben M. Chen](https://http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~bmchen/) as a part of the [Unmanned Systems Research Group](https://http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/). I received a Bachelor’s degree and Master's degree in Environmental Engineering from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://www.nuaa.edu.cn/) in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

I received my PhD degree from MIT's [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/) on September 2021, advised by [Noelle Selin](http://www.selingroup.org/noelle-eckley-selin). I also worked closely with my committee members:  [Valerie Karplus](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/valerie-karplus.html), [Cory Zigler](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/zigler/home) and [Colette Heald](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/colette-l-heald/). I received bachelor degrees in environmental sciences and economics from Peking University in Beijing. 

My broad research interest is in environmental and energy policies with a global focus on issues involving air pollution, climate change, and energy transitions. Specifically, I study the interplay between air pollution and climate change, two critical environmental challenges for humanity in the coming decades. My research uses causal inference, machine learning, atmospheric chemistry modeling, remote sensing to study the sustainability challenges at the intersection of energy, pollution and climate using real-world data. My PhD research has spanned the electricity, industrial, and transportation sectors in China, US, and EU. From a methodology perspective, I am interested in developing data-driven approaches with insights from complex atmospheric chemistry models (such as [GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/)) and understanding the uncertainty and limitations of econometric and statistical models in such application.
